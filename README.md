# GoldenNote
Hi！This is my android project. Here I implemented a reminder for users to add notes, which is inspired by "Reminder" from ios when I was using my iphone. It is worth mentioning that the “today” and "tomorrow" part really attracted me.

Requirements:

1. As a user, I want to be able to have my account signed in to the system
2. As a user, I want to be able to add an event to the reminder.
3. As a user, I want to be able to check all events I make before.
4. As a user, I want to be able to add title and also short description to an event.
5. As a user, I want to be able to add date to a event to reminder me better.
6. As a user, I want to be able to check all upcoming events(for example, tomorrow) to have enough time to prepare.
7. As a user, I want to be able to sign out from the system.

All requirements above has been implemented.
